## 介绍
PinyinRocketMac 是一个超级轻量级、超级高效的应用程序，旨在立即消除简体中文用户在 macOS 11 及以上版本开机使用一段时间后经常遇到的鼠标一直转彩虹圈圈 (wait cursor)、系统响应极缓慢等问题。该问题很可能是由 macOS 自带的简体拼音输入法引发的。

只需一键点击应用图标，即能立刻恢复性能，这样就不用耗时间重启了。在这种卡机的情况下想去切换至不同窗口/ app 以在重启前进行保存数据等必要的操作都难，在菜单里选择重启选项还要按几次鼠标，每次按完都要等它极慢的响应。

## 特点 & 使用方式
- **超级简单的操作：** 只需在触控板上五指捏合，或打开启动台 (Launchpad)，找到此 app 的 logo，点下去，一秒钟就解决这个系统非常慢的问题了。
- **超级轻量级：** 此 app 大小仅有几 MB，无需任何隐私权限，无需在后台持续运行占用额外内存；不用事先启动，用毕自动退出。

## 安装
1. 从 GitHub 仓库下载 PinyinRocketMac.app.zip。
2. 解压并将其中的 app 移至“应用程序” (Applications) 文件夹。理论上，您可以将应用程序放在您喜欢的任何位置，只要您可以，并有耐心在 Mac 运行速度极慢时进入文件路径并打开此应用。
3. 非常频繁遇到此问题的用户可将此 app 添加至 Dock 栏，更加方便快捷地使用。

## Introduction
PinyinRocketMac is an ultra-lightweight and highly efficient application designed to immediately eliminate common issues faced by Simplified Chinese users on macOS 11 and above. These issues include the persistent appearance of the spinning rainbow cursor (wait cursor) and extremely slow system response after the system has been booted and used for a while. The problem is likely caused by the built-in Simplified Pinyin input method of macOS.

With just a single click on the app's icon, you can instantly restore performance, saving you the time and hassle of having to reboot. When the system is lagging, it becomes difficult to switch to different windows/apps to save data or perform other necessary operations before rebooting. Even selecting the restart option from the menu requires several slow mouse clicks.

## Features & Usage
- **Super Simple Operation:** Simply pinch with five fingers on the trackpad, or open the Launchpad, find the logo of this app, and click it. In just one second, the problem of the system being extremely slow is solved.
- **Super Lightweight:** The app is only a few MB in size, requires no privacy permissions, and does not need to run continuously in the background, consuming extra memory; it does not need to be launched in advance and exits automatically after use.

## Installation
1. Download PinyinRocketMac.app.zip from this GitHub repository.
2. Decompress the .zip file and move the app therein to the "Applications" folder. Theoretically, you can place the app wherever you like, as long as you are able to, and have the patience to get inside the path and open the app when the Mac is extremely slow.
3. Users who frequently encounter this issue can add this app to the Dock for even more convenient and quick access.
